## About Me  
I am currently studying Computer Engineering at **PUC-Campinas** and I am looking for opportunities that challenge me to grow both personally and professionally. During the last semester, I worked on projects that allowed me to deepen my knowledge in web development, computer architecture, and entrepreneurial thinking, including creating software solutions based on real needs. In addition, I learned the importance of teamwork and other essential aspects for my development as a professional.
